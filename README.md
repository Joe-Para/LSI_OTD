# LSI_OTD

A project for building the hardware and software for measuring time delay on fiber cables in distributed measurmeent systems.

## To Do (Software)
* Integrate/debug TDC Driver
* Build I2C driver for display/buttons(could maybe rip apart the adafruit lib)
* Build I2C driver for the fiber optic trancievers 
* Build driver for interrupts
* Finish control flow (maybe a state diagram would be helpful here)
* Test vs lab equiptment to see if time delay meausreed it good


## To Do (Finalization)
* **DOCUMENTATION**
* Ensure robust error checking and error recovery
* Maybe add an options file for the workstation?
